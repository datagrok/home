# Configuration now relies on environment variables; this makes it easy to
# configure many hosts using a case switch in .profile. Variables used here:
#
# SCREEN_CK: screen command key (2 characters); see 'escape' configuration
# option in 'man screen'. Default screen behavior is '^Aa' where ^A is ctrl-v
# ctrl-a
# SCREEN_CKR: screen command key reminder: readable version of SCREEN_CK
# SCREEN_CL: screen color: choose from 'kr kg ky kb km kc kw' or leave blank

# This is the default but I want to make it explicit: don't do login shells
# unless I ask for it.
deflogin off

# Change the default command char on my workstations to allow screen to run in
# connections to remote servers as well.
escape $SCREEN_CK

# Status line: command char - hostname - status - window list - load - date - time
# The status (aka XTerm title) is set with echo -e '\033]0;message\007'

# If we're connecting to other servers through screen terms, keep ssh-agent
# working between reconnections. I forgot from where I got the idea for this
# technique, and I can't find anyone who uses it. TODO: investigate and
# document. Possibly, change to one of these techniques (better?):
